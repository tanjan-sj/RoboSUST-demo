A demo website for a research-based robotics organization, RoboSUST.

The css and html for the landing page was inspired from MIT Media Lab website. This is an undergrad project where no design patterns were used.

Most work was done on the Login/Registration module where any RoboSUST member could login if registered, and if not, click on the reigstration button -> fill up necesary info -> an email gets sent to an admin account for approval of this new user with a link to approve of the user -> if the admin approves, the new user can login to a new account.
